RN#1 UART communication protocol
RN#1 BRAIN (STM32F205) <-> Host computer

115200 8N1 during first development
If necessary, going to 1Mbaud/s - at least Raspi needs some config editing to support higher than 115200 baudrates.


Bytes 128...255 denote START delimiters for different data types
After the START delimiter, the data structure follows
All data bytes have MSb='0'


Rationale:
* Good frame synchronization with start delimiter occuring often
* No special signals or no timing-based delimiters needed -> best portability
* No TX, RX state machines needed (as with escaping)
* Constant framing overhead, and constant data structure lengths instead of variability of escaping
* In many cases, actual values can be represented with 7, 14, 21 etc. bits (instead of 8, 16, 24...) so in these cases, there is no overhead.
