RN#1 UART communication protocol
RN#1 BRAIN (STM32F205) <-> Host computer

115200 8N1 during first development
If necessary, going to 1Mbaud/s - at least Raspi needs some config editing to support higher than 115200 baudrates.


Bytes 128...255 denote START delimiters for different data types
After the START delimiter, the data structure follows
All data bytes have MSb='0'
Multi-byte data is always little-endian (LSB is transmitted first)


Rationale:
* Good frame synchronization with start delimiter occuring often
* No special signals or no timing-based delimiters needed -> best portability
* No TX, RX state machines needed (as with escaping)
* Constant framing overhead, and constant data structure lengths instead of variability of escaping
* In many cases, actual values can be represented with 7, 14, 21 etc. bits (instead of 8, 16, 24...) so in these cases, there is no overhead.



MESSAGES PC-->RN#1 (aka commands)

0x80 MSG_MOVE
	sint7	speed	0 = stop, - = backwards
	sint7	arc	0 = go directly, - = left

0xFE MSG_MAINTENANCE
	3xuint7	0x42, 0x11 and 0x7A magic key numbers
	uint7	Operation:
		0x41	Reconfig UART speed
			uint16	STM32F205 baud rate register contents to be applied
		0x51	KILL_PWR (with emptyish battery: shutdown. With good battery: hard reset)
		0x52	Run flasher
			Flasher reconfigs the UART to 115200 8N1. Framing with MSB-denoted delimiters is not being followed anymore.
			Separate flasher protocol is specified elsewhere.
			Flasher cannot exit; it always ends up in hard reset.
		

MESSAGES RN#1-->PC (aka status)

0x80 MSG_GYRO		3D digital MEMS gyroscope data
	uint7	status	1 = gyro OK
	sint14	int_x	Integral of gyro X, zeroed at previous MSG_GYRO message
	sint14	int_y	                 Y
	sint14	int_z                    Z

0x81 MSG_XCEL		3D digital MEMS accelerometer data
	uint7	status	1 = xcel OK
	sint14	int_x	Integral of xcel X, zeroed at previous MSG_XCEL message
	sint14	int_y	                 Y
	sint14	int_z                    Z

0x82 MSG_COMPASS	3D digital MEMS compass data
	uint7	status	1 = compass OK
	sint14	avg_x	Average of compass X, after the previous MSG_COMPASS message
	sint14	avg_y	                   Y
	sint14	avg_z                      Z

0x83 MSG_OPTFLOW	Optical flow sensor (ground camera)
	uint7	status
	sint14	dx	X delta after previous MSG_OPTFLOW
	sint14	dy	Y
	uint7	q	Surface quality

0x84 MSG_LIDAR		LIDAR image, latest full turn
	Note: This is a large data frame, 1Mbps communication is recommend to keep latency of other messages down.
	uint7	status
	360*uint14	Distance in mm; 0 = no datapoint (reflectance issue, for example)
	
0x85 MSG_SONAR		SONAR data (latest distances, max 7 sonars)
	uint7	status  List of enabled sonars (0b0001111 for sonars 0,1,2,3 for example)
	7*uint14 distances	Distances in cm for sonars 0,1,2,3,4,5,6;  0 = no datapoint (no echo received)
